# GuessTheNumberUltimate
Just a test program that uses Java to make a guessing game with three different, customizable game modes.

# Modes
* Integer
  A simple mode where the user guesses a random integer. The user can input a difficulty integer as well which affects the range of numbers that can be chosen. For instance, 6 would be integers from 1 through 6. Probably the most practical mode to play.
* Character
  Similar to Integer mode but uses letters of the alphabet. There are two options for this mode: single case and double case. Single case is the easy one, where the characters will all be converted to uppercase. In double case, your option and the correct option can be either uppercase or lowercase. Great if you are tired of guessing numbers.
* Double
  Similar to integer mode but generates a decimal instead of an integer. The user can input two difficulty options. The first affects the range of numbers, similar to the Integer mode. A second option affects how many decimal places the answer will have. Play this if you really hate winning.
